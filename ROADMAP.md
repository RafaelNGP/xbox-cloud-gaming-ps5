# Roadmap

Where PSBox Cloud Gaming goes next, most valuable first. Each item says why it
matters, what "done" looks like, and how it is measured on the console.
Status: **next** (being worked on), **planned**, **later**, **dropped**.

Last update: 2026-10-09, after v0.9.0.

## Now

### 1. Lower input-to-picture latency — done (v0.6.0)
Measured with `VK_KHR_present_wait`, from a frame's network arrival to the
moment it is on the TV: **~23 ms on average** at 60 Hz (decode ~6 ms, GPU
~3 ms, waiting for the next vblank ~8 ms on average). The earlier "13-48 ms"
stopped at `present()`, not at the screen.

- Each frame is submitted once the one before is on the screen (no queued
  frames: the wait for a free image fell from 1-3 ms to 0.01 ms), and a frame
  is skipped when a newer one is already waiting. Skipped frames in a 50 s
  run: 85 → 35.
- The game menu shows "On screen after" (that measurement, live).
- **Next step, 120 Hz output** (halves the vblank wait, ~4 ms): the title
  declares it with `attribute3 = 0x80040`; on our console the display still
  offered only 59.94 Hz. To check: the TV's 120 Hz support and the PS5's
  120 Hz output setting, then re-registering the app.

### 2. Hardware video decoding — works, parked
RADV has no Vulkan Video on the PS5, but the system's own decoder
(`libSceVideodec2`, sysmodule 207) works from the app: H.264 1080p decodes to
NV12 (pitch 2048, coded 1088 rows) in **~6 ms**, the same as FFmpeg on the
CPU, as BlackBearReloaded's research measured too. So no latency gain at
1080p; it only frees a CPU core.

- Kept in `src/media/hw_decoder.*` (autoplay `hwdecode` runs it alongside and
  logs it), with the PS5's own structure layouts and memory types.
- Becomes the way to go if 1440p / 4K or HEVC streams are ever granted.

### 3. Reconnect after a network drop — done (v0.6.0)
As the xbox.com client does: when the connection drops (a data channel or
WebRTC fails, or no video packet for 3 s), the stream tries again up to 20
times a second apart; each time it checks that the cloud session is still
`Provisioned` / `ReadyToConnect` and opens a new WebRTC connection on it.
The game goes on where it was. The server ending the session (idle kick,
the game closed) still ends the stream.

- Console test (autoplay `droptest`, the connection dropped at 20 s):
  reconnected on the first attempt, ~8 s of frozen picture, then 60 fps again.
- To check by hand: a real outage (cable out / Wi-Fi off for ~10 s).

### Also in v0.6.0
- **DualSense light bar** in the colour of the game in focus (Settings).
- **Anime4K x2** as an upscaler beside FSR (game menu: Upscaling): crisper
  outlines and text, but it also sharpens compression noise; ~1-2 ms more.
  Next to try: Anime4K's Restore network before the upscale.
- **Free-to-play games** (#10): xbox.com's free-to-play row; one not on the
  account yet shows FREE, with the store's QR code to get it, and Play.
  The server refuses a free game until it is got once (`NoEntitlement`);
  the app explains that and tries again. Got on the phone, it starts at once.
- **Windows outside the game** (Marvel Rivals' NetEase terms): touch input
  is announced on while the game is out of focus; the page then shows its
  own pad cursor. A touchpad pointer was tried and dropped (the page
  ignored the touches, and it got in the way of the account picker).

### Remote Play (own Xbox) — done (v0.7.0)
The xhome offering takes the same Xbox token: "My consoles" lists the
account's consoles (`/v6/servers/home`), and a home session is started
with the console's serverId; the stream is the cloud one. Series X on the
same network: 1080p, 9-17 Mbps, 7-10 ms round trip. A sleeping Xbox wakes
through the session itself (~10 s); one that doesn't answer
(`WaitingForServerToRegister`) is asked again, then the app says what to
check. Also in v0.7.0: the Xbox button (game menu, or a swipe up on the
touchpad), "End the stream", a new session after a drop, and notes when
the Xbox ends or turns off the stream.

- Resolution: what each kind of stream delivers is measured (1080p for
  both here; the browser gets 1080p from this Xbox too), and 1440p is only
  offered once delivered. The own Xbox is always asked for its top tier:
  ~15.7 Mbps instead of ~9.5.

### Picture clean-up — done (v0.8.0)
- **Anime4K Restore (S)** before the upscale, for FSR and Anime4K alike
  ("+ clean-up" in the game menu, the default with FSR): on Fortnite at
  ~5 Mbps, edges 50% stronger with the same noise in flat areas, and no
  measurable latency (on screen 26-29 ms either way).
- **Auto block smoothing**: high below ~5 Mbps, low up to ~10, off above,
  with 1 Mbps margins and 3 s before a change (the default).
- Settings from before v0.8.0 that still hold the old defaults move to
  the new ones, once.

### Network reliability — done (v0.8.0)
Mbed TLS built with its own locking (MBEDTLS_THREADING_C): concurrent
HTTPS requests no longer fail with -0x006E ("This is a bug in the
library"), and a GET with no answer is retried once. Host stress test
(`xcloud-cli tls-stress`): 960 parallel requests, 0 failures (before: 2
runs in 3 failed).

### Safer changes and releases — done (v0.9.0)
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): the desktop build and unit tests on
  every push and pull request, and a scan of each pull request for tokens
  and private files.
- `tools/release.sh <X.Y.Z> [out] [--console]`: checks the version,
  contentVersion, tag and changes, builds and packages without the
  account, checks inside the zip and eboot.bin, optionally streams on the
  console, and prints the publish commands and the catalog record. It
  publishes nothing.

### `ps5_main.cpp` split — done (v0.9.0)
It had grown to 1,586 lines. Now: `ps5_main.cpp` (start-up and the home
screen's loop), `worker.cpp` (sign-in, library, consoles, playing),
`stream_screen.cpp` (the game's menu, gestures, controllers, overlay),
`price_loop.cpp`, `autoplay.cpp` (the unattended tests) and
`auto_deband.cpp`, whose "auto" block smoothing now has unit tests.

### In-app updates — done (v0.9.0)
After sign-in the app asks for the latest release and offers a newer one
(a pop-up with "Update now" / "Not now", and Settings > Updates). The zip
must be signed (ECDSA P-256) with the maintainer's key, which
`tools/release.sh` uses; a package that isn't that version or isn't newer
is refused. Files are swapped in place with a backup (an update cut short
is rolled back at the next start), then the app restarts itself
(`sceSystemServiceLoadExec`, from the main thread).

### Controls and search — done (v0.9.0)
- Controller icons as DualSense silhouettes; the light bar's colour from
  the game, a colour picker (live on the pad), or off; the confirm button
  shown as its symbol, in force from the next press.
- Trigger vibration tester: strength, frequency, resistance (the DualSense
  pushes back) and force pulses; the console takes trigger modes 0..3 only.
- Each stick's own dead zone, radial with rescaling, set in a stick tester.
- Search: Mode, Genre, Language (in the app's language) and Console lists;
  Lowest price by the discounted price. Modes and languages come from the
  store's full details, fetched once in the background and cached.

### Fast scrolling, inertia, fresher catalog and "All games" grid — done (v0.9.1)
- The right stick pages through the lists (3 rows up / down, 6 cards
  sideways), and so does a swipe on the touchpad, with smooth inertia.
- "All games" (Game Pass) expands into a 6-column vertical grid: all 550+
  titles accessible with 2D D-pad navigation, smooth vertical row scrolling,
  and clean viewport clipping under the headers and tabs.
- Cached game details older than 30 days are fetched again, 40 per start,
  oldest first.

## Next

| Item | Why | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-game settings (next release) | A profile per game (picture, triggers, dead zones, controls) that overrides the general settings for that game only; games without one use the general ones | medium |
| Publisher filter | 918 publishers: the most frequent first, studios of one owner grouped | medium |
| Friends playing now | Xbox social / presence APIs; privacy to handle | large |
| Keyboard and mouse filter / icon | The store marks games that take them; together with keyboard and mouse support | small |
| Voice chat (microphone) | xCloud has a chat channel; needs PS5 audio capture | large |
| USB keyboard and mouse | Some xCloud games accept them | medium |

## Dropped (and why)

- **More picture filters**: with FSR and deband, what remains is the bits the
  server doesn't send.
- **Higher tiers on this account**: 1080p HQ, 1440p, H.265, a Tizen-TV
  identity and `rateControlBitrateUpdate` were all refused by the service
  (measured, see the v0.4.0 / v0.5.0 PRs). The app still asks for HQ.
- **HDR**: xCloud doesn't stream HDR.

## Done

- "All games" (Game Pass) as an expanded vertical grid: uncapped 550+ games in 6 centered columns, 2D D-pad navigation, smooth vertical row scrolling and clean clipping under header and tabs.
- v0.5.0: picture on the GPU, FSR 1 upscaling to 4K, block smoothing.
- v0.4.0: game menu, PS5 keyboard in games, frame metadata reports, CAS
  sharpness, trigger vibration, local multiplayer, controller settings.
- v0.3.0 and earlier: Game Pass / Your games tabs, search, prices, regions,
  RTCP feedback, rumble.
